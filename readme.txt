A project for the 2018 python bootcamp hosted by the Erdos Institute.

All data used in this project was obtained from Baseball Reference: https://www.baseball-reference.com/

The goal of the project is to look at TeamWAR and the effect on team wins. The first part of the project looks at
data from the 2008-2017 NL seasons and consists of some simple data cleaning and linear regression. Later, we would like
to consider AL data and more seasons, as well as the effect of team composition on team wins.

All the data used in the project has been included, as well as the relevant AL data for the next steps. There are currently
three notebooks consisting of initial analysis and a short presentation for the pitch festival at CoverMyMeds.

The script cleaning_team_war.py allows for easy cleaning of the data from baseball-reference. It was written to clean
NL TeamWAR data, but could easily be adjusted to clean AL data or other team data obtained from baseball-reference.
